# SprigganTS

Cross platform, event-driven pixel art games running in your browser.

Currently undergoing specification.

## Features

### Fully event-driven animation and input

SprigganTS has no "render loop"; code only runs:

- At startup.
- When animations complete.
- When the user clicks or taps sprites or presses buttons.

This means that the browser or host can choose how best to schedule animations/etc. to get the best performance and battery life.
However, it is not a good fit for every game; physics-driven simulations requiring continuous iterations or "ticks" are better served by other engines.

### Integrated content pipeline

Content is built and packaged as part of the source code's build process.

#### Code Metadata Generation

TypeScript is generated for every asset.  This means that your game code is aware of every asset, at compile-time.  Missing, or incorrectly named assets are detected before the game runs and identified by the TypeScript compiler.

#### Packaging

All content needed to play the game is packaged into few, slightly larger files.  These are pre-loaded at start-up, ensuring that the game does not crash, even if played from a server through an unstable network connection.

Non-critical content (backgrounds, music, etc.) is loaded as-required.  It will be missing if the connection drops, but the game will continue playing.

#### Content Types

##### Sprites

Small, animatable pieces of pixel art.  Packed into a single sheet, or "atlas", which is loaded at start-up.
There may be small differences in how these are aligned depending upon browser/device.

##### Backgrounds

Large images which cover the entire screen, sitting behind the sprites.  These may be animated.  These are loaded on-demand; a black background will be shown if the background cannot be loaded.

As such, no information required to play the game should be in the background.

##### Sounds

Short sound effects which are played as "fire-and-forget".  Loaded at start-up, or after the first tap on mobile devices due to browser restrictions.

##### Music

Looping music tracks.  One is played at a time.  Loaded on-demand; may only start playing after a delay, or not at all if cannot be loaded.  If played from startup, mobile devices will not play until the user taps due to browser restrictions.  Additionally, many browsers will "skip" when the track should loop.

As such:

- Do not attempt to synchronize the music and gameplay.
- Do not make it neccessary to hear the music to play the game.
- A half second of silence at the start and end of the music is recommended to prevent a skip on loop.
- Music should ramp up smoothly to avoid jarring starts if playback is delayed by loading.

#### Included Integrations

Please note that these integrations are not created, endorsed or supported by the third party applications' developers or publishers.
These integrations may only work with a narrow selection of versions or platforms.

| Application | Version                 | Content Types        | File extensions              |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Aseprite    | 1.2-beta11              | Sprites, Backgrounds | .sprite.ase, .background.ase |
| FL Studio   | 12.4.1 Build 4 (32 Bit) | Sounds, Music        | .sound.flp, .music.flp       |

### Compatability

A combination of compatability fallbacks and in-depth manual testing means that games which do not directly use browser APIs should "just work".

#### Input Devices

Currently, only mouse clicks and touchscreen taps on sprites and backgrounds are supported.
This is to ensure maximum compatability between desktop and mobile devices.

Gamepad input is planned, but not currently implemented.

#### Tested Hosts

This is based on the Hydride techdemo of SprigganJS, the previous iteration of this engine, which is implemented similarly.

### Debugging

Three aspects of SprigganTS make it easy to debug your games.

- The scene graph directly translates to DOM elements, which can be inspected using your browser's debugger.
- The lack of a "render loop" greatly reduces the "noise" visible in timeline views due to callbacks tied to the monitor's refresh rate.
- TypeScript and the generation of code metadata from assets mean that errors are caught before the game starts.

## Developing Games

### Build

NPM is used as a simple build system, while Visual Studio Code is used as an IDE.

- Install NodeJS (LTS is recommended). https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Install Git.  https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Add Aseprite's Aseprite.exe to the PATH variable. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)
- Add FL Studio's FL.exe to the PATH variable. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)
- Fork and clone this repository to your machine.  https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/

#### Via Visual Studio Code

- Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
- Open Visual Studio Code.
- File -> Open Folder.
- Enter the folder where you cloned your repository, and click Select Folder.
- Press Ctrl+Shift+B.
- The build will start and run.  This may take a few minutes.
- You should be able to test the game by navigating to http://localhost:3333 in your browser.
- Any changes you make should automatically rebuild the game in the background.  You will need to refresh your browser to see them.

#### Via CLI

There are two available NPM scripts which build the game:

##### Build once

    npm install
    
Installs all dependencies, and places a build in the Build directory.

##### Build on changes

    npm run-script develop
    
Installs all dependencies, and places a build in the Build directory every time a file is changed.
It can be played at http://localhost:3333 in your browser.

### TypeScript API

The entry point for the TypeScript application is Source/Entry.ts.  The "StartGame" function will be executed when all content required to play the game has been loaded.

All methods in the API are "bound", meaning that it is safe to directly call them:

    // No wrapping function required here.
    Content.Battle.Sky.Day.Play(Content.Battle.Sky.Sunset[0].Play)

#### Configuration

At the top of Source/Entry.ts is a reference to Source/Configuration.ts.  This file is shared between the runtime engine and build process, and defines:

##### ResolutionX

The number of horizontal pixels in the "emulated" screen.

##### ResolutionY

The number of vertical pixels in the "emulated" screen.

##### Crop

When true, the display is cropped to the "emulated" screen.  When false, it may overflow to fill the entire display or window.  This needs to be used with care.

#### Content

The build process will generate the file Source/Content.ts.  This contains an object hierarchy mimicking your directory structure (and often the records inside the content files), with objects containing the associated metadata.

Directories containing only consecutive numbers will be turned into arrays.

For instance, the following directory structure:

    '-Source
      '- Battle
         |'- Sky.background.ase (contains an animation containing Day/0 and Day/1, and single frame animations Sunset/0 and Sunset/1)
         |'- Character.sprite.ase (contains single frame animations Idle, Walk/A and Walk/B)
         |'- Theme.music.flp
          '- Effects.sound.flp (contains mixer channels Sword, Ouch)
         
Will produce the following object:

    const Content = {
        Battle: {
            Sky: {
                Day: new BackgroundAnimation(new BackgroundFrame(...), new BackgroundFrame(...)),
                Sunset: [new BackgroundFrame(...), new BackgroundFrame(...)]
            },
            Character: {
                Idle: new SpriteFrame(...),
                Walk: {
                    A: new SpriteFrame(...),
                    B: new SpriteFrame(...)
                }
            }
            Theme: new Music(...),
            Effects: {
                Sword: new Sound(...),
                Ouch: new Sound(...)
            }
        }
    }
    
##### Metadata Types

These are not intended to be constructed by your game code.

###### SpriteFrame

A single still image which may be applied to a sprite.

    // Number of seconds.
    Content.Battle.Character.Idle.Duration
	
	// See below for an example of applying a SpriteFrame to a Sprite.

###### BackgroundFrame

A single still image which is shown behind all sprites, filling the virtual screen.

    // If these fail to load, the background will be black.
    // The following methods interrupt the previously playing animation.

    Content.Battle.Sky.Day.Play()
    
    Content.Battle.Sky.Day.Play(() => console.log("Called when finished"))
    
    Content.Battle.Sky.Day.Loop()

###### SpriteAnimation, BackgroundAnimation

A collection of SpriteFrame/BackgroundFrame objects representing an animation.  May be used in the exact same ways as SpriteFrame/BackgroundFrame.

###### Sound

A "fire-and-forget" sound.

    // Number of seconds.
    Content.Battle.Effects.Sword.Duration

    // This may do nothing on some platforms.
    Content.Battle.Effects.Sword.Play()

###### Music

A looping music track.  

	// This may be delayed while it loads.
	// It may do nothing on some platforms.
	Content.Battle.Theme.Loop()

#### Scene Graph

SprigganTS uses a scene graph when rendering.  This runs at a fixed "emulated" resolution.

All objects are drawn by walking the tree depth first, nodes ordered by when they were added to the parent.  That is:

    |'-Group A
    | |'-Group AA
    | | |'-Drawn behind everything else.  Added before the below.
    | |  '-Drawn behind group AB.  Added after the above.
    |  '-Group AB
    |    '-Drawn on top of group AA, but behind group B.
     '-Group B
       '-Drawn on top of everything else.
      
By default, scene graph objects are added to the root of the scene graph.

The origin of the screen is the top left corner.

##### Sprite

A visible object, which displays a SpriteFrame.

    new Sprite()

    new Sprite(() => console.log("Called when the sprite is clicked or tapped"))

    // The following methods interrupt the previously playing animation.
    
    new Sprite().Play(Content.Character.Idle)
    
    new Sprite().Play(Content.Character.Idle, () => console.log("Called when finished, but not if interrupted"))
    
    new Sprite().Loop(Content.Character.Idle)
    
##### Group

An invisible object, which can contain other scene graph objects.

    new Group()

    new Group(() => console.log("Called when any child in the group or their children are clicked or tapped"))
    
    // Moves the referenced scene graph object under this group.
    // Pause/resume/hide/show state and animations/movements will be retained.
    new Group()
        .Add(new Group(...))
        .Add(new Sprite(...))

##### Common Methods

The following methods exist on all scene graph objects:

    // Movement functions interrupt any previous motion.
    // Child scene objects, and their scene objects, will move with ours.

    // Moves to 25 emulated pixels right of the origin of our container, 34 down of the origin of our container, immediately.
    groupOrSprite.Move(25, 34) 
    
    // Moves from the current position to 25 emulated pixels right of the origin of our container, 34 down of the origin of our container, over 0.6 seconds.

    groupOrSprite.MoveOver(25, 34, 0.6)
    
    groupOrSprite.MoveOver(25, 34, 0.6, () => console.log("Called when finished, but not if interrupted.")
    
    // Moves from the current position to 25 emulated pixels right of the origin of our container, 34 down of the origin of our container, at 250 emulated pixels/second.
    groupOrSprite.MoveAt(25, 34, 250) 
    
    // Temporarily removes the scene graph object and its children from the scene graph, hiding them and ignoring clicks/taps (what lies underneath will accept them instead).
    // Animations may continue while hidden, and trigger events.
    // No effect if already hidden.
    groupOrSprite.Hide()
    
    // Undoes .Hide().
    // No effect if not hidden.
    groupOrSprite.Show()
    
    // Temporarily freezes all animation and motion in the scene graph object and its children.
    // Does not count as an interruption.
    // Clicks will still be accepted.
    // No effect if already paused.
    groupOrSprite.Pause()
    
    // Undoes .Pause().
    // No effect if not paused.
    groupOrSprite.Resume()
    
    // Permanently removes the scene graph object and its children from the scene graph, hiding them and ignoring clicks/taps (what lies underneath will accept them instead).
    // Animations will not continue, and events will not be triggered.
    groupOrSprite.Delete()
    
    // Gets the (possibly non-integer) number of emulated pixels the scene graph object is right of its parent's origin.
    groupOrSprite.X()
    
    // Gets the (possibly non-integer) number of emulated pixels the scene graph object is right of otherGroupOrSprite's origin.
    groupOrSprite.X(otherGroupOrSprite)
    
    // Gets the (possibly non-integer) number of emulated pixels the scene graph object is below its parent's origin.
    groupOrSprite.Y()
    
    // Gets the (possibly non-integer) number of emulated pixels the scene graph object is below otherGroupOrSprite's origin.
    groupOrSprite.Y(otherGroupOrSprite)
    
#### Events

The following classes exist to help organize events in your game logic.

##### Once

Only calls listeners on the first call to Raise().
Listeners added after Raise() are called immediately.

    const once = new EventOnce<() => void>()
    once.Listen(() => console.log("Logged second"))
    once.Listen(() => console.log("Logged third"))
    console.log("Logged first")
    once.Raise()
    once.Listen(() => console.log("Logged fourth"))
    console.log("Logged last")
    once.Raise()
    
##### Recurring

Calls listeners once on every call to Raise().
Listeners added after calling Raise() are not called until the next call to Raise().
    
    const recurring = new EventRecurring<() => void>()
    recurring.Listen(() => console.log("Logged second and fifth"))

#### Scheduling

Although SprigganTS uses setTimeout and setInterval under the hood, it only uses these to trigger an internal event queue, to ensure that the order of events is deterministic regardless of browser or device.
These types use this event queue, so it is recommended to use them over setTimeout and setInterval directly.

    const once = new TimerOnce(0.4, () => console.log("Called after 0.4 seconds"))

    const once = new TimerOnce(0.4, () => console.log("Called after 0.4 seconds"), () => console.log("Called if cancelled before completing"))
    
    const once = new TimerOnce(0.4, () => console.log("Called after 0.4 seconds"), () => console.log("Called if cancelled before completing"), (elapsedSeconds, elapsedUnitInterval) => console.log("Called periodically during the timer"))

    const once = new TimerOnce(0.4, undefined, () => console.log("Called if cancelled before completing"))
    
    const once = new TimerOnce(0.4, undefined, () => console.log("Called if cancelled before completing"), (elapsedSeconds, elapsedUnitInterval) => console.log("Called periodically during the timer"))
